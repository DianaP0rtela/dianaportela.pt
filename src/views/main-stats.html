    for different experiences around the corner.<br />Here you have some curious things about me.

              <case n="'profile'">
                When I was younger I used to be a swimmer and sports always played a key role in my life.
                A small plot twist, among many others, I've danced <em>6</em> different dance styles,
                and won the <em>4th place at European Roxy Snowgirls Championship.</em>
              </case>

              <case n="'airplane'">
                I have travelled in all <em>5</em> continents, visiting <em>46</em>
                different countries, both hemispheres,
                and backpacking in both <em>North and South America</em> and <em>Australia</em>.
              </case>

              <case n="'map'">
                While living most of my time in Portugal, I've also soon taken up
                the experience to study and work abroad.
                Until now I was living abroad in <em>10</em> different cities
                from <em>3</em> continents.
              </case>

              <case n="'water'">
                I am an <i>icy dip enthusiast</i>, which means I might say that I go
                for a swim at the ocean around <em>300</em> days a year
                <i>(out of rainy days, of course!)</i>.
              </case>

              <case n="'car'">
                My passion about nature and the sea <i>is ancient!</i>
                When I was 15 years old I tryied to raise money from my bricolage
                portfolio to buy a trailer to live in front of the sea!
              </case>

              <case n="'paint'">
                Back in the days, I used to play with bricolage, ceramics, oils and other paintings.
                Later on, a glimpse of interest in photography led me to win
                <em>1st prize at EIT Health Alumni Summit</em> Photography competition 
                and the <em>2nd place</em> at an university competition.
