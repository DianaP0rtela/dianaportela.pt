                I have travelled in all <em>5</em> continents, visiting <em>46</em>
                different countries, both hemispheres,
                and backpacking in both <em><i>N & S</i> America</em> and <em>Australia</em>.
                Such experience enhanced my <tag> intercultural communication</tag>, <tag>contextual intelligence</tag>,
                <tag>adaptability</tag> and <tag>independence</tag>.
              </case>

              <case n="'map'">
                While living most of my time in Portugal, I've also soon taken up
                the experience to study and work abroad.
                Until now I was living abroad in <em>12</em> different cities,
                from <em>7</em> countries in <em>3</em> continents. I speak 4 languages: <tag>Portuguese</tag> (mother language), <tag>English</tag> (C1),
                <tag>French</tag> (B2) and <tag>Spanish</tag> (B1). During this time I definitly
                developed a spirit of <tag>self-governance</tag>, <tag>teamwork</tag> and <tag>leadership</tag>.
              </case>
              
              <case n="'profile'">
                Sports always played a key role in my life. <i>I used to be a <em>swimmer</em> and I love <em>hicking</em>!</i>
                Among many others, I've danced <em>6</em> different dance styles,
                and won the <em>4th place at European Roxy Snowgirls Championship.</em>
                This habits that shape you defined my high <tag>commitent</tag>, <tag>responsibility</tag>, 
                and <tag>punctuality</tag>. But the strategic thoughts also enhanced my 
                <tag>critical thinking</tag>, <tag>complex systems thinking</tag> and <tag>detail-oriented</tag> mindset.
              </case>

              <case n="'paint'">
                I am a <tag>creative</tag> person. Back in the days, I used to play with bricolage, ceramics, oils and other paintings.
                Later on, a glimpse of interest in photography led me to win
                <em>1st prize at a Summit Conference</em>.
                <i>Nowadays I code!</i> <br />
                I developed competences in <em>data visualization</em>
                using <tag><u></u>PowerBI</u></tag>, <em>statistical analysis</em>
                using <tag><u>R</u></tag> and <tag><u>Python</u></tag> and in <em>cloudbased data management</em> tools
                like <tag><u>SharePoint</u></tag>.
              </case>

              <case n="'water'">
                I am an <i>icy dip enthusiast</i>, which means I might say that I go
                for a swim at the ocean around <em>300</em> days a year
                <i>(out of rainy days, of course!)</i>.
              </case>

              <case n="'car'">
                My passion about nature and the sea <i>is ancient!</i>
                When I was 15 years old I tryied to raise money from my bricolage
                portfolio to buy a trailer to live in front of the sea!
