    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>
      I graduated from med school in <em>2017</em> in Porto.
      Throughout my Master's Degree in <em>Medicine</em>, I had the opportunity to do
      exchange programs thus developing essential skills such as team working and adapting to
      different people and realities. During this period, I realized how crucial and important
      minor details in healthcare can be, and hence the huge impact upon the overall quality of
      life of populations worldwide as well as how healthcare changes drastically from country
      to country. Undeniably, my backpacking experience in Australia and South America
      instilled an incredible and inexplicable passion towards understanding this phenomenon
      better.

      Dealing with such opposite healthcare realities, I realized how much work there is
      and can be done outside hospitals. In fact, global processes affect health from a global to
      individual level as well as across time and space, which consequently has changed my
      mindset, in other words, <i>the manner in which I intend to “practice health”</i>.

      During my medical residency in Public Health, I managed an internship in Public Health, an academic year of a <em>PhD in Health Data Science</em>,
      a post-graduation in <em>IT Management</em>, and scientific and informal publications.
      Furthermore, during all this time I was actively involved in the <em>European Innovation and Technology Health community</em>, being its local representative in Porto. For the last year,
      I've worked in IT management at the <em>European Monitoring Center of Drugs and Drugs Addictions (EMCDDA) and afterwards for the <em>Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)</em>
        at the Health Division where I was involved in several projects regarding Best Practices in Public Health.</em>
