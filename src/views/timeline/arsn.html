    I started my Public Health residency in <i>ACES Entre o Douro e Vouga 1.</i>
    During this time, I had the change to work in local support to health-related public health constraints.
    I was also deeply involved in COVID-19 case management where I defined and developed an information system
    for collecting and analyzing data at the local level.

    Later on I started to work in a regional level, mainly on the management of cancer screening programs.
    During my work in the Northern Regional Administration in Portugal I was deeply involved
    in applying business intelligence approaches for cancer screening programs optimization and
    information systems applied which made me develop a special interest in this area.

    Additionally, I worked on data governance for the implementation of an
    API technology through the health information system for the Prevention and Control of Infections
    and <i>Antimicrobial Resistance - PPCIRA</i>, currently being a member of the management team of the 2-CIACS project
    and working group of <em>PPCIRA</em>.
