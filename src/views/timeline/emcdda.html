    The <em>European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)</em>
    is the reference point on drugs and drug addiction information in Europe.
    Here, I had the chance to do a 8 months trainship at the ICT Unit.

    I was initially assigned to work with the <em>head of sector ICT Service Delivery</em>,
    complementing her role as Project Manager for the <em>ECID project</em>,
    an important pluri-annual EMCDDA project fostering digital innovation in the areas of collaboration,
    document and records management.

    Soon it became apparent that besides the initial assignment, I was curious to take on other challenges.
    Thus, I conducted an ICT self-assessment regarding the cybersecurity maturity and preparedeness of the
    organization using the NIST reference framework and COBIT 19.

  <p>
    Latter on, I was also involved in the <em>Data Foundation</em> Project and on business intelligence metrics,
    where I was active in presenting new insights on existing unexplored data sources,
    using <tag>BI tools (MS Power BI)</tag>, data arquitechire designs and concerns on its developments.

    During this intership I also had the change to attend the <em>Digital Youth Summit</em>
    in Bucharest, allowing me to share ideas with multiple stakeholders about the future of digitalization and
    IT in EU.

    <i> I'm deeply grateful for my supervisors Eng. Andrea Classen and Eng. Pedro Ribeiro
      who gave me the opportunity to do an internship within the organization,
      integrated me in their team as family and critically guided me with constructive feedback
      which enhanced my skills and performance on any work done. </i>
