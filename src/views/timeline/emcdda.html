    Better Image Viewer was a Google Chrome Extension made with plain <tag>HTML</tag>
    and <tag>JavaScript</tag>. It allowed users to view images inside Google Chrome
    with a more elegant way, and had a lot of features like rotating the image, zooming,
    among others.

    The extension had <em>200k downloads</em> and a peak of <em>30k daily users</em>.
    I maintained the extension for some years until I sold it to an Israeli company.
