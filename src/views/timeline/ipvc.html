    I'm graduated as a <em>Graphic Computation Engineer</em> on Instituto Polit√©cnico de Viana do Castelo.
    I proudly got the Ministry of Education <em>Merit Award</em> in 2011, for finishing with the highest
    average of the institution that year.

  <p>
    I learned a lot during these 3 years, some of my projects were a queue waiting simulation, in <tag>C++</tag>,
    a multiplayer Bingo game in <tag>AS3</tag> with a <tag>C#</tag> socket server, or a Tank missile game in
    <tag>OpenGL</tag>, among many others.
