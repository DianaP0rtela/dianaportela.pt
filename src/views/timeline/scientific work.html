    This was my first job, I was mainly a web developer and learned more in a few months than I could expect.
    I learned <tag>Ruby on Rails</tag>, <tag>PHP</tag>, <tag>JavaScript</tag> and many concepts of <tag>GIS</tag>
    (Geographic information systems), I was able to improve my knowledge a lot.

  <p>
    I've collaborated on a few projects, but I was able to achieve many others on my own, <em>B-Around Map</em>,
    was probably the biggest challenge I had, it's a library that allows to add a map module to a page
    (a Google Maps with its own layout).

    and a lot <tag>jQuery</tag> and <em>Inova Gaia</em> website using <tag>Ruby on Rails</tag> and also<tag>jQuery</tag>
    (popular at that time).
