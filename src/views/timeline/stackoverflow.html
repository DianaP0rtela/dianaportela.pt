    Every developer knows Stack Overflow, it's the biggest question and answer
    site for developers. I started to post answers to old unanswered questions
    on the site and soon the thrill of getting positive feedback for my contributions
    led me to contribute more and more.

    Nowadays I have almost 200 answers and a lot of points and badges on the site.
